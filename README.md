# Spotify-Data-Pipeline-on-AWS
This project uses various AWS services to build an ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipeline for data fetched from the Spotify API. The pipeline retrieves data from the Spotify API, transforms it to a desired format, and loads it into an AWS data store for further analysis using Amazon Athena.
